Although, this new version of the KDD data set still suffers from some of the problems discussed by McHugh and may not be a perfect representative of existing real networks, because of the lack of public data sets for network-based IDSs, we believe it still can be applied as an effective benchmark data set to help researchers compare different intrusion detection methods. Furthermore, the number of records in the NSL-KDD train and test sets are reasonable. This advantage makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete set without the need to randomly select a small portion. Consequently, evaluation results of different research work will be consistent and comparable.\n","\n","\n","\n","### Data files\n","* <span style=\"color:green\">**KDDTrain+.ARFF**: The full NSL-KDD train set with binary labels in ARFF format</span>\n","* KDDTrain+.TXT: The full NSL-KDD train set including attack-type labels and difficulty level in CSV format\n","* KDDTrain+_20Percent.ARFF:\tA 20% subset of the KDDTrain+.arff file\n","* KDDTrain+_20Percent.TXT:\tA 20% subset of the KDDTrain+.txt file\n","* KDDTest+.ARFF:\tThe full NSL-KDD test set with binary labels in ARFF format\n","* KDDTest+.TXT:\tThe full NSL-KDD test set including attack-type labels and difficulty level in CSV format\n","* KDDTest-21.ARFF:\tA subset of the KDDTest+.arff file which does not include records with difficulty level of 21 out of 21\n","* KDDTest-21.TXT:\tA subset of the KDDTest+.txt file which does not include records with difficulty level of 21 out of 21\n","\n","### Download of data files\n","https://iscxdownloads.cs.unb.ca/iscxdownloads/NSL-KDD/#NSL-KDD\n","\n","### Additional references on the dataset\n","_M.
