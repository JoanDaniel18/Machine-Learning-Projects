To overcome this issue, we installed the Android applications on a real device and captured its network traffic. See our publicly available Android Sandbox.\n","\n","The CICAAGM dataset is captured by installing the Android apps on real smartphones in a semi-automated manner. The dataset is generated from 1,900 applications in the following three categories:\n","\n","**1. Adware (250 apps)**\n","* Airpush: Designed to deliver unsolicited advertisements to the user’s system for information stealing.\n","* Dowgin: Designed as an advertisement library that can also steal the user’s information.\n","* Kemoge: Designed to take over a user’s Android device. This adware is a hybrid of botnet and disguises itself as popular apps via repackaging.\n","* Mobidash: Designed to display ads and compromise the user’s personal information.\n","* Shuanet: Similar to Kemoge, Shuanet is also designed to take over a user’s device.\n","\n","**2. General Malware (150 apps)**\n","* AVpass: Designed to be distributed disguised as a Clock app.\n","* FakeAV: Designed as a scam that tricks users into purchasing a full version of the software to remediate non-existing infections.\n","* FakeFlash/FakePlayer: Designed as a fake Flash app to direct users to a website (after successful installation).\n","* GGtracker: Designed for SMS fraud (sends SMS messages to a premium-rate number) and information stealing.\n","* Penetho: Designed as a fake service (a hack tool for Android devices that can be used to crack WiFi passwords). This malware can also infect the user’s computer via infected email attachments, fake updates, external media, and infected documents.\n","\n","**3. Benign (1500 apps)**\n","* 2015 GooglePlay market (top free popular and top free new)\n","* 2016 GooglePlay market (top free popular and top free new)\n","\n","### Data Files\n","* pcap files – the network traffic of both malware and benign apps (20% malware and 80% benign)\n","* .csv files - the list of extracted network traffic features generated by the CIC-flowmeter\n","\n","### Data File Download\n","https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/android-adware.html\n","\n","### Additional References on the Dataset\n","_Arash Habibi Lashkari, Andi Fitriah A.
